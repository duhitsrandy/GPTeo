# Phase 2 Complete: Scan Submission Flow

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. Server Actions (`actions/scans.ts`)
- **createScan** - Creates a new scan and enqueues it for processing
- **getScanById** - Fetches a single scan with all related data
- **getUserScans** - Lists all scans for the current user
- **getUserScanStats** - Calculates aggregate statistics
- **cancelScan** - Cancels a running or queued scan
- **normalizeDomain** helper - Validates and normalizes domain inputs

### 2. Job Queue System (`lib/queue.ts`)
- Simple in-memory queue (MVP implementation)
- Processes scans one at a time
- Auto-enqueues when scans are created
- Includes placeholder scanning logic for testing
- **Ready to upgrade to BullMQ + Redis** for production

### 3. UI Components

#### Scans Dashboard (`/dashboard/scans`)
- **NewScanForm** - Form to submit new scans
  - Domain input with validation
  - Multiple URL inputs (up to 10)
  - Scan mode selector (quick/standard/deep)
  - Real-time form validation
  
- **ScansTable** - Lists recent scans
  - Shows domain, status, scores, mode
  - Color-coded status badges
  - Links to detailed view
  - "Load More" pagination

- **StatsCards** - Overview statistics
  - Total scans, completed, running, queued
  - Average SEO and GPTeo scores
  - Animated icons for running scans

#### Scan Details (`/dashboard/scans/[scanId]`)
- Dual score display (SEO + GPTeo)
- Status-specific messaging
- Summary statistics
- Configuration details
- **Ready for Phase 3** detailed findings

### 4. Navigation
- Updated sidebar with Scans section
- Reorganized navigation (Scans, Account, Support)
- Clean icon set with lucide-react

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/dashboard/scans`
2. Fills out the New Scan form (domain + URLs)
3. Clicks "Start Scan" → Server action creates scan record
4. Scan is auto-enqueued and status is "queued"
5. Queue picks up scan → status changes to "running"
6. Placeholder scanning logic runs (~3-5 seconds)
7. Scan completes with random scores → status "completed"
8. User can view results on detail page

### Technical Flow
```
Client (Form)
  ↓ submit
Server Action (createScan)
  ↓ insert to DB
Database (scans table)
  ↓ enqueue
Job Queue (scanQueue)
  ↓ process
Scan Worker (simulateScan)
  ↓ update
Database (scan results)
  ↓ display
Client (Results Page)
```

## 📦 Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - Date formatting for tables

## 🚀 Next Steps: Phase 3

Before starting Phase 3 (Crawler & Analyzer), **you need to apply the database migration**:

### Required: Apply Database Migration

```bash
# 1. Start local Supabase instance
npm run db:local

# 2. Apply migration (creates all tables)
npm run db:migrate

# 3. Seed initial checks
npm run db:seed
```

After migration, you'll have:
- ✅ All 9 tables created
- ✅ 25 checks loaded (10 SEO + 15 GPTeo)
- ✅ Foreign keys and constraints set up

---

## 🧪 Testing the Flow (After Migration)

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to `/dashboard/scans`**

3. **Create a test scan:**
   - Domain: `example.com`
   - URL: `https://example.com/product/item`
   - Mode: Quick
   - Submit

4. **Watch the scan progress:**
   - Status: queued → running → completed (3-5 seconds)
   - Check browser console for queue logs
   - Refresh page to see updated status

5. **View results:**
   - Click "View" button on completed scan
   - See placeholder scores and summary

---

## 🔄 Current Limitations (MVP)

### Queue System
- **In-memory only** - Resets on server restart
- **No concurrency** - Processes one scan at a time
- **No retry logic** - Failed scans don't auto-retry
- **No persistence** - Job queue not stored in DB

### Scanning Logic
- **Placeholder only** - Generates random scores
- **No actual crawling** - Doesn't fetch URLs
- **No checks running** - Doesn't execute check handlers
- **No page storage** - Pages and findings tables not populated

### UI
- **No real-time updates** - Must refresh page
- **No progress indicator** - Can't see % complete
- **No detailed findings** - Results page shows summary only
- **No export** - Can't download PDF/CSV reports

---

## 🎯 Phase 3 Preview: Crawler & Analyzer

Next phase will implement:

1. **HTTP Fetcher** - Download page content
2. **Playwright Integration** - Render JS-heavy sites
3. **Data Extractors** - Parse JSON-LD, meta tags, HTML
4. **Check Handlers** - Execute each check against extracted data
5. **Scoring Engine** - Calculate weighted scores
6. **Results Storage** - Populate pages, findings, summaries

## ✅ Ready for Phase 3?

**Yes, if:**
- ✅ Migration applied (`npm run db:migrate`)
- ✅ Checks seeded (`npm run db:seed`)
- ✅ Dev server running (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Can create and view test scans

**No, if:**
- ❌ Database migration not applied
- ❌ Supabase not running
- ❌ Environment variables missing

---

**Status:** Phase 2 Complete ✅  
**Next:** Apply migration → Test → Phase 3 (Crawler & Analyzer)
